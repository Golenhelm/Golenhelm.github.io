        <h1>Jakob Nielsen's Usability Heuristics </h1>
        <h2>#9: Recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</h2>
        <h3>By Emil Roland Marun</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Errors will happen. Despite your best efforts, something is always bound to go wrong. And, you need to be
            ready for when it does. The ninth of Jakob Nielsen’s ten Usability Heuristics is: recognize, diagnose, and
            recover from errors. Following this practice when designing a website will ensure that if a user encounters
            an error, they will have a better chance of fixing it, or, at the very least, of knowing what went wrong.

        <div class="container">
            <figure>
                <img src="img/example_1.png" width="500">
                <figcaption><a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">Google's</a> account creation form
                </figcaption>
            </figure>
        </div>
        <p>In order for a user to recognize that there is an error, it must be visible. This can primarily be achieved
            with an error message. Another way to attract a user’s attention is with visual treatment. A simple example
            of visual treatment would be outlining an input field in red. The Google account creation form is a great
            example of both of these techniques being used in unison.</p>
        <p>So, an error has occurred, the user has spotted it. That is great, but now the user needs to be able to
            understand it: to diagnose it. The easiest solution is to word the error message clearly and concisely.
            Also, use plain
            language.</p>
        <p>The next step is to provide recovery information. Giving the user information about how to recover from an
            error is crucial. Preferably this information would be in the error message itself. But, that is not always
            feasible. In some cases it is simply better to give the user a hyperlink or shortcut to where they can fix
            the problem.</p>
        <p>If you implement these practices in your site and an error does occur, then a user should be able to spot the
            error, understand it, and resolve it. </p>
